## The Pitch
This isn't the first mouse-tracking screen recorder, and it probably isn't the best.  
But there's a reason I built SWOOSH: in all my searching, I've yet to find a cross-platform, FOSS alternative that does what I need.  
This isn't a screen recorder for everyone - SWOOSH is built for product presentations, which means anybody trying to stream gameplay or record for tech support is going to find it incredibly useless.
SWOOSH is for me - and maybe, somewhere out there, for someone else too.
